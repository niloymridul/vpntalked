Welcome back to the second part of the tutorial. This part of the tutorial is where we will give you an understanding of the osTicket interface, the roles in it, and the ticketing system we use to work it. Before we begin please log in to your account. Hopefully, remember the password and username. Feel free to experiment along the way.

First, we are going to configure roles. We will need to make and address a Supreme Admin as that is the person who has total control over everything. Click Admin Panel -> Agents and then click Roles. Go ahead and give it every permission for tickets, tasks, and knowledgebase. Now the person for this role can do anything and everything.
